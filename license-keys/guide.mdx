## Creating a License Keys

If you haven't already [created your company](https://docs.whop.com/creating-company) or [made a product to sell](https://docs.whop.com/creating-company#creating-your-first-product), you'll want to start there.

Once you've done that, head to the dashboard to add the license key capability to your product.

## Metadata

Metadata is a way to store information about a license key. The most common use case for this is to store information about the usrs device, HWID. **HWID** is a unique identifier for a device, and can be used to prevent users from sharing their license keys with others.

<Warning>
  The user can reset their metadata anytime by going to their dashboard and
  clicking the `Reset Key` button.

#### How to get a users HWID

<CodeGroup>
    ```js JavaScript
    const machineId = require('node-machine-id');

    function generate_hwid() {
        return machineId.machineIdSync();
    }
    ```

```python Python
import hashlib
import platform

def generate_hwid():
    return hashlib.sha256(platform.node().encode()).hexdigest().strip()
```

## Validating a License Key

The metadata field in the body is **required**. If you do not wish to set any metadata, you can pass an empty object.

```json
{ "metadata": {} }
```

<CodeGroup>
    ```js JavaScript
    import axios from 'axios'

    const validate_license = async (license_key, HWID) => {
        const response = await axios.post(
        `https://api.whop.com/api/v2/memberships/${license_key}/validate_license`,
        {
            headers: {
                Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
            },
            body: {
                metadata: {HWID: HWID},
            },
        }
        )
        return response
    }
    ```

    ```python Python
    import requests

    def validate_license(license_key, HWID):

        url = f"https://api.whop.com/api/v2/memberships/{license_key}/validate_license"

        payload = {"metadata": {"HWID": HWID}}
        headers = {
            "accept": "application/json",
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
            "content-type": "application/json"
        }
        response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
        return response
    ```
