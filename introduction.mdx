**Whop** allows you to sell access to your applications and services. It's a simple and secure way to monetize your work. This documentation will guide you through the process of integrating Whop into your application, whether it's a **web app**, **mobile app**, **desktop app**, **or anything else you may want to sell**.

To get started, we recommend you check out [this page](/oauth-license) to get a grasp of the possible integration types, and which would be best suited to your needs. You can also check out the [examples page](/examples) to see real-world examples of how Whop can be used.

## Integration types

There are two main ways to integrate Whop into your application:

- **OAuth**
- **License Keys**

### OAuth

OAuth is like a digital key that allows access to certain parts of your web application. It acts as a doorman, checking if the user has the right credentials (proof of purchase) before letting them in.

### License keys

A License Key is a unique identifier generated by Whop for each user who has made a purchase. It acts like a special access code that users can input to gain access to your application.
