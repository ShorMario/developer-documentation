**Whop** allows you to sell access to your applications and services. It's a simple and secure way to monetize your work. This documentation will guide you through the process of integrating Whop into your application, whether it's a **web app**, **mobile app**, **desktop app**, **or anything else you may want to sell**.

To get started, we recommend you check out [this page](/oauth-license) to get a grasp of the possible integration types, and which would be best suited to your needs. You can also check out the [examples page](/examples) to see real-world use cases of Whop.

## Integration types

Whop offers two primary methods for integrating into your application:

- **OAuth**
- **License Keys**

### OAuth

OAuth is a protocol that acts as a digital key, granting authorized access to specific parts of your web application. It functions as a doorman, verifying a user's credentials (proof of purchase) before granting access.

### License keys

A License Key is a unique code generated by Whop for each user who makes a purchase. Users can enter this code to unlock and gain access to your application.
