## Integration types

There are two main ways to integrate Whop into your application:

- **OAuth**
- **License Keys**

### OAuth

OAuth is like a digital key that allows access to certain parts of your web application. It acts as a doorman, checking if the user has the right credentials (proof of purchase) before letting them in.

### License keys

A License Key is a unique identifier generated by Whop for each user who has made a purchase. It acts like a special access code that users can input to gain access to your application.
