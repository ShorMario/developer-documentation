## Ways to sell

**Whop** offers two primarry methods for selling your application:

- **OAuth**
- **License Keys**

### OAuth

OAuth is a protocol that acts as a digital key, granting authorized access to specific parts of your web application. It functions as a doorman, verifying a user's credentials (proof of purchase) before granting access.

### License keys

A License Key is a unique code generated by Whop for each user who makes a purchase. Users can enter this code to unlock and gain access to your application.
