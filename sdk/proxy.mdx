description: How to use Whop Proxy
---

This proxy is designed to proxy traffic (ie requests) from an iframe to the localhost developer URL of the developer's local development server.
In the proxy, we fetch a user token and forward it to the app mimicking the behaviour of the Cloudflare proxy in production.

## Usage

### Install

These commands are already included in the `@whop-apps/sdk` package. However, if you would like to install it on its own, you can run the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash yarn
yarn add @whop-apps/dev-proxy
```

```bash npm
npm install @whop-apps/dev-proxy
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @whop-apps/dev-proxy
```

</CodeGroup>

### Run

<Note>
  If you are using **NPM**, you need to add ```"whop-proxy": "whop-proxy"``` to
  the **scripts** section of your `package.json` file.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```bash yarn
yarn whop-proxy
```

```bash npm
npm run whop-proxy
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm whop-proxy
```

</CodeGroup>

### Configure

The proxy can be configured using the following command line options:

```bash
Usage: yarn whop-proxy [options]

Options:

--proxyPort <port>      The port the proxy should listen on (3000 by default)
--upstreamPort <port>   The port the upstream server is listening on (set automatically by default)
--npmCommand <command>  The npm command to run to start the upstream server (dev by default)
--command <command>     The command to run to start the upstream server (npm run dev by default)
```
