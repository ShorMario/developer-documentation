title: Validate Token
description: "Authenticate the user"
---

To ensure that the user has purchased your app, and it isn't being used by someone else, we have created a function that you can use to validate that the user is allowed access.

For this function, you need to get the user's token from the cookies, it is called `whop_user_token`.

If you are using Next.js, you can use the `headers` object from `next/headers`

You should use this on every page that you want to be gated.

```typescript
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { validateToken } from "@whop-apps/sdk";

export default async function AdminPage() {
  await validateToken({ headers });
}
```
