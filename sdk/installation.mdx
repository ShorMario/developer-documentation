The Whop SDK makes it easier to build apps. It provides a set of tools that are commonly used in apps, such as authentication, API requests, push notifications, and more.

To install our SDK, you need to run one of the following commands:

<CodeGroup>

```bash yarn
yarn add @whop-apps/sdk
```

```bash npm
npm install @whop-apps/sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @whop-apps/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>
