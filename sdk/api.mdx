description: Use the SDK to use our API and return it in a formatted JSON response
---

The API SDK allows you to interact with the Whop API without having to manually write the requests. All responses are typed which gives you type safety.

The API SDK supports 2 modes, **user** and **server**.

## User Mode

Use User Mode to make requests on behalf of the user. This will use the users access token to make requests. This is useful for getting information about the user, such as their name, email, and experiences. You will need to either pass the users access token, or the `headers` object from `next/headers`.

### Usage

```typescript
import { WhopAPI } from "@whop-apps/sdk";
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export default async function Home() {
  // Using the users access token
  const me = await WhopAPI.user({ headers }).GET("/me", {});
}
```

---

## Server Mode

Use Server Mode to make requests on behalf of the company. This will use the API key to make requests. This is useful for getting information about the company, such as the company name, email, and experiences. You will need to pass the API key as a string.

You can either manually provide the API key, or the SDK will automatically fetch it from the **WHOP_API_KEY** environment variable.

### Usage

```typescript
import { WhopAPI } from "@whop-apps/sdk";

export default async function Home() {
  // Using the users access token
  const user = await WhopAPI.server().GET("/users/{id}", {
    params: { path: { id: "user_XXXXXX" } },
  });
}
```

<Accordion title="How to get your API Key">

To get the API key for your app, head to your [**app's settings page**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer). You will then see the API Key card, where you can copy or reset your key.
