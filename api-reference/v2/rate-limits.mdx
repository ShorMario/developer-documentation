This page outlines the rate limits for the V5 API.

Currently, the rate limits are as follows:

| Endpoint    | Limit                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| `/api/v5/*` | 20 requests every 10 seconds  |
| `/api/v2/*` | 100 requests every 10 seconds |

If you hit this limit, there will be a cooldown of 60 seconds before you can make any more requests.

## Rate Limit Response

If you hit the rate limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with the following body:

```json
{
  "message": "You are being rate limited"
}
```
