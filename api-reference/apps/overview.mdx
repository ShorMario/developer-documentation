Requests are scoped to the app making the request (an app cannot request details for a business that has not insalled it).

### Common Use Cases

- Fetching information about a company
- Sending notifications to users
- Creating line items

### Requirements

1. **App API Key**
   > This can be found in your app's settings page.
