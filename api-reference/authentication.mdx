Access to the Whop API can be granted through two methods: API Keys and OAuth Credentials. All requests must include an `Authorization` header with the format `Bearer {TOKEN}`, where `TOKEN` is either the API key or the OAuth access token.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}
```

Each API has its own method of authentication. You can read more about each API's authentication below:

- [Me API](/api-reference/me/overview)
