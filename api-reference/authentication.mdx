There are two ways to get access to the Whop API, API Keys and OAuth Credentials.

All requests require an `Authorization` header. `TOKEN` in the example is either the API key or the OAuth access token.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}
```

## API Keys

API keys are an essential tool for accessing and integrating with Whop's API. An **API key** is a unique identifier that allows a developer to access Whop's API on behalf of a company and validate licenses, retrieve user information, and more.

<Warning>
  It's important that you keep your API keys safe and secure - if not properly
  scoped, your API keys can be dangerous if they fall into the wrong hands.
</Warning>

### Creating an API key

1. Head to your Developers setting panel under your business
2. Click **New API Key**
3. Set a memorable name for your key.
4. Copy the API key

### Scoped API keys

Scoped API keys provide access to specific resources or endpoints within Whop's API, rather than providing access to the entire API. This helps to ensure that the client-side code is only able to perform the specific actions that it needs to, while also limiting the potential for security vulnerabilities.

Scoped API keys are **the best way** for your company to use client-sided keys.

### Instructions to create a scoped API key

1. Create a new API key under the **Developers setting panel**
2. Click the triple dots and click **Edit permissions**
3. Add the permissions you want this key to have access to. If you are storing keys **client-side**, we recommend keeping your permissions as minimal as possible.
4. Save!

<Warning>
  If you are altering any memberships, make sure this is done server-side,
  client-side requests should only be used for validation.
</Warning>

### Recommended API key scopes

- **Validate a license key**
  - `Membership/Validate License`
- **Retrieve a license key**
  - `Membership/Retrieve Membership`

## OAuth Credentials

Head to the [developer settings page](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer) to obtain your Client ID and Client Secret. These keys will be used to identify your website/app and authenticate it in the Whop API.

<Warning>
  You will not be able to view your Client Secret again after you close the
  modal. Make sure to store it somewhere safe. You can always generate a fresh
  one, but your previous one will be invalidated.
</Warning>
