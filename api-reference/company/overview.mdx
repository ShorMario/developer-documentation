The company API routes allow companies to directly access information about their business.

If you manage a business on Whop, this API is for you. You can use this API to retrieve data about your business.

## Common Use Cases

- Retrieving a single membership
- Listing your payments
- Creating line items for in app purchases

## Authentication

All requests will need your **company API Key**. This can be found on your [**developer settings page**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer). Be sure not to expose this API key on the client side. For more information on company API keys, click [**here**](/api-reference/authentication#api-keys)

<Tip>
  If you have used the **V2 API**, this will be the same API key you used there.
