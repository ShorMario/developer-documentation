The company API routes allow companies to directly access information about their business. This means that the API can return sensitive data such as Stripe IDs, and revenue figures.

### Common Use Cases

- Querying memberships
- Fetching products

### Requirements

1. **Company API Key**
   > This can be found in the [**developer settings page**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer). For more information on company API keys, click [**here**](/api-reference/authentication#api-keys)

<Tip>
  If you have used the **V2 API**, this will be the same API key you used there.
