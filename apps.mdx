## Why should I make an app

### Advantages for Companies

Developing your own apps allows your business to offer **hyper-niche** experiences catered to your unique needs. This approach not only enhances user experience, but also sets you apart from your competition.

### Advantages for Developers

As you can monetize your apps, you can take a cut every time a company users your app. This is a great way to make a passive income, without needing to deal with the hassle of marketing and sales.

## How to make an App

If you are using Next.js, we recommend you use our [Next.js Template](/apps/next-template) to create your app, it will get your started faster and you can skip some mundane setup.

If you would like to get started from scratch, you can follow our [App Development Guide](/apps/overview).
