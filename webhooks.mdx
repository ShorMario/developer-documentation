---

Webhooks are a way for an application to provide real-time notifications to other systems when certain events occur. They allow you to build integrations that respond to specific events in a more efficient and scalable way than constantly polling an API for updates.

In this guide, we'll explore how to set up and implement webhooks, including establishing a webhook endpoint, configuring your webhooks, and handling webhook notifications. We'll also provide examples in both JavaScript and Python.

## Use-cases

Webhooks can be utilized for various purposes, such as:

- Automatically crediting a user's account when they make a purchase.
- Displaying a banner on your website when a user's subscription is nearing expiration.
- Adding new subscribers to a custom mailing list when they sign up for a subscription.

## Webhook Types

<Note>If you are not developing an app, you can skip this section.</Note>

For [**apps**](/apps/overview), there will be two types of webhooks. One being for when a business signs up and purcahses your app, and the second being when a user performs an action on a product that uses your app.

To differentiate, we have added an extra value into the webhook payload. If the webhook is to do with a user performing an action, you will see this a **company ID**:

```json
{
  "action": "",
  "company": "biz_id",
  "data": {}
}
```

However, if it is trigged by a business that owns your app, it will be `null`.

```json
{
  "action": "",
  "company": null,
  "data": {}
}
```

## Creating a webhook

Access the Whop Business dashboard and navigate to the developer settings page. Here, you can configure your webhook endpoint URL, as well as manage all other aspects of the Whop API.

<Note>
  Upon adding the webhook, it will send a `POST` request to your API. If the API
  doesn't return a 200 status code, the webhook will not be added.

## Setup a server

To receive webhooks, you need a server capable of handling POST requests. You can achieve this using any programming language.

In the following example, we're creating a server to receive data at the `/went-valid` endpoint. The server parses the relevant information from the JSON payload, allowing you to take actions like adding a user to your database or sending a custom email.

### Hosting the server

You can host the server anywhere you want, but we recommend using a free service like [**ngrok**](https://ngrok.com/) or [**Hop.io**](https://hop.io/). Both providers offer free tiers suitable for deploying an API.

After setting up and deploying your server, obtain the provided URL and add it to the webhook settings page. Remember to append `/went-valid` to the URL (or the appropriate endpoint name).

<CodeGroup>

```python Flask
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/went-valid', methods=['POST'])
def went_valid():
    data = request.json # Get the JSON payload

    membership_id = data['data']['id'] # This value is unique per membership
    user_id = payload['data']['user']['id'] # This is their Whop user ID
    user_email = payload['data']['user']['email']
    product_id = payload['data']['product']['id']
    plan_id = payload['data']['plan']['id']

    return jsonify(data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

```javascript Express.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const app = express();

// Use body-parser middleware to parse JSON data
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post("/went-valid", (req, res) => {
  const data = req.body;

  const membership_id = data.data.id;
  const user_id = data.data.user.id;
  const user_email = data.data.user.email;
  const product_id = data.data.product.id;
  const plan_id = data.data.plan.id;

  res.json(data);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port 3000`);
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Testing your API

Input the correct route into the modal and click the **"Send test webhook"** button. Our server will attempt to `POST` an example webhook event to the provided endpoint. If your application accepts the request and returns a 200 HTTP response code, you will see a green message indicating "**Test successful"** Your endpoint will now start receiving events.

<Note>
  To view all webhook payloads, check the [**events**](/webhooks/events)
  section.
