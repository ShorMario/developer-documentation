---

Webhooks are a way for an application to provide real-time notifications to other systems when certain events occur. They allow you to build integrations that respond to specific events in a more efficient and scalable way than constantly polling an API for updates.

In this guide, we'll explore how to set up and implement webhooks, including establishing a webhook endpoint, configuring your webhooks, and handling webhook notifications. We'll also provide examples in both JavaScript and Python.

## Use cases

Webhooks can be utilized for various purposes, such as:

- Automatically crediting a user's account when they make a purchase.
- Displaying a banner on your website when a user's subscription is nearing expiration.
- Adding new subscribers to a custom mailing list when they sign up for a subscription.

## Webhook Types

<Note>If you are not developing an app, you can skip this section.</Note>

For [**apps**](/apps/overview), there will be two types of webhooks. One is for when a business signs up and purchases your app, and the second is when a user performs an action on a product that uses your app.

To differentiate, we have added an extra value to the webhook payload. If the webhook has to do with a user performing an action, you will see this a **company ID**:

```json
{
  "action": "",
  "company": "biz_id",
  "data": {}
}
```

However, if it is trigged by a business that owns your app, it will be `null`.

```json
{
  "action": "",
  "company": null,
  "data": {}
}
```

## Creating a webhook

Depending on your use case, you can create a webhook for a company or an app.
