<Note>
  The dashboard for this feature is not complete, we expect it to be complete
  October 4th. If you would like to use it, please reach out to us and we can
  manually set it up for you.
</Note>

There are 2 ways to notify members through Whop, either by sending a push notification to our mobile app or through the notifications tab on the website.

## Usage

To send a notification, you need to make a `POST` request to the [**/notifications**](/api-reference/apps/notifications/send) endpoint.

If you are using our SDK, you can do it easily through the WhopAPI function. Here is an example:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK
WhopAPI.server().POST("/notifications", {
  body: {
    topic_identifier: "string",
    notification_data: {
      all: {
        subject: "string",
        content: "string",
      },
    },
    targets: [
      {
        users: ["string"],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.whop.com/v5/notifications \
  --header 'Authorization: <authorization>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "notification_data": {
    "all": {
      "content": "string",
      "subject": "string"
    }
  },
  "targets": [
    {
      "users": [
        "string"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "topic_identifier": "string"
}'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Topic Identifier

The `topic_identifier` is a unique identifier for the notification you want to send. You can set that up in the Developer Dashboard:

[INSERT GUIDE HERE ONCE FLOW IS DONE]

### Notification data

In this object, there are 3 keys: `all`, `in_app`, and `mobile`.

The `in_app` key is used to send a notification to the user's notification feed either on the Whop website, or mobile app. This is useful for less important notifications, such as XXX

The `mobile` key is used to send a push notification to the user's mobile device. This is useful for important and time-sensitive notifications, such as alerting a user to a sneaker restock.

The `all` key is used to send a notification to both the user's notification feed and mobile device.

In each of these, there are the `subject` and `content` keys. The `subject` key is used to specify the subject of the notification, while the `content` key is used to specify the description of the notification.

### Targets

The targets array is used to specify who should receive the notification. There are 2 ways to specify who should receive the notification, either by specifying the `experiences` key, or the `users` key.

Each is an array, of either the `experience_id` or `user_id` respectively. Using `experiences` is the easiest way to send to all users of a specific experience, while using `users` is the easiest way to send to a specific user.
