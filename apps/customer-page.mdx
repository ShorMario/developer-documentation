## What you'll learn

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to do the following tasks:

- Use the Whop API to check more advanced permissions
- Build a page that is shown to all customers
- Use Frosted components to style your app

## Prerequisites

In order to view the iFrame as a customer, you will need to own a membership to this app. To do this, make a free pricing option for your product and purchase a membership. Then open the app from your orders page.

## 1. Create your customer page

We will start by building the **customer page.**

The **customer page** is a specific page URL your app defines. Everytime a Whop user purchases a membership that contains your app, they will view the customer page within the iFrame whenever viewing your app.

1. Create a page to match this URL `/customer/$productId`. To do this, create this file: `/app/customer/[productId]/page.tsx`

```bash
mkdir app/customer && mkdir "app/customer/[productId]" && touch "app/customer/[productId]/page.tsx"
```

In order to know which product the user purchased, Whop will pass the ID as a **path parameter**.

2. Add the following code to your file to read and display the product ID

```typescript
export default async function CustomerPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: { productId: string };
}) {
  const productId = params.productId;
  return <h1>The ID of the product the user is viewing is {productId}</h1>;
}
```

3. Update the Customer Path in your [app configuration](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer) to be `/customer/$productId`

   </Frame>

4. Navigate to your iFrame URL (this should be easily found from your orders page), ensure you're in developer mode, and you should see your page!

</Frame>

## 2. Authenticate the user

Once the user is viewing your page, we will want to make sure they are a valid Whop user with permissions to view this company. Let's begin.

1. Add two imports to the top of your page

```typescript
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { validateToken } from "@whop-apps/sdk";
```

2. Use the `validateToken` function from the Whop SDK to ensure the user's access token is valid

```typescript
export default async function AdminPage() {
  const { userID } = await validateToken({ headers });
}
```

<Warning>
  You should **always** call `validateToken` on every page you define. This will
  ensure the user is not being malicious.
</Warning>

At this point the user is authenticated and we have their Whop User ID

## 3. Check if the user owns the product

We now want to check to make sure this user owns the correct product. To do this, we will use the **Whop API.**

The Whop SDK comes pre-installed with functions to interact with the Whop API.

1. Retrieve the company using the Whop API

```typescript
const result = await WhopAPI.user({ headers }).GET("/products/{id}", {
  params: { path: { id: params.productId } },
});
```

This code snippet says to use the Whop API, authenticated as the user (we pass in the user's auth token through `headers`), and fetch the product with the ID passed from the **path parameter.** If the user does not hold an active membership to this product, an error will be returned.

2. Handle the error case if the user does not have access

```typescript
if (result.isErr) {
  return <h1>You do not have access to view this.</h1>;
}
```

If you `result.isErr` is false, the user holds an active membership. At this point, you have confirmed with the Whop API that the user has access to view this page.

Now we have confirmed the user has access to this product

## Next steps

- Launching in production
- Set up webhooks to get notified in real time
- Interact with the Whop API using your App's authentication
- Understanding constraints of the iFrame, like opening links
