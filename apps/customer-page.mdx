## What you'll learn

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to do the following tasks:

- Use the Whop API to check more advanced permissions
- Build a page that is shown to all customers
- Use Frosted components to style your app

## Prerequisites

In order to view the iFrame as a customer, you will need to own a membership to this app. To do this, make a free pricing option for your product and purchase a membership. Then open the app from your orders page.

## 1. Create your customer page

We will start by building the **customer page.**

The **customer page** is a specific page URL your app defines. Everytime a Whop user purchases a membership that contains your app, they will view the customer page within the iFrame whenever viewing your app.

1. Create a page to match this URL `/customer/$productId`. To do this, create this file: `/app/customer/[productId]/page.tsx`

```bash
mkdir app/customer && mkdir "app/customer/[productId]" && touch "app/customer/[productId]/page.tsx"
```

In order to know which product the user purchased, Whop will pass the ID as a **path parameter**.

2. Add the following code to your file to read and display the product ID

```javascript
export default async function CustomerPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: { productId: string },
}) {
  const productId = params.productId;
  return <h1>The ID of the product the user is viewing is {productId}</h1>;
}
```

3. Update the Customer Path in your [app configuration](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer) to be `/customer/$productId`

   </Frame>

4. As you are trying to view the app as a customer, you will need to own the product. Once you have purchased it, head to the [orders page](https://whop.com/orders/products) and click on your membership. From here you can access the app and enable developer mode.

## 2. Authenticate the user

Once the user is viewing your page, we will want to make sure they are a valid Whop user with permissions to view this company. Let's begin.

1. Add two imports to the top of your page

```javascript
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { validateToken } from "@whop-apps/sdk";
```

2. Use the `validateToken` function from the Whop SDK to ensure the user's access token is valid

```javascript
export default async function AdminPage() {
  const { userID } = await validateToken({ headers });
}
```

<Warning>
  You should **always** call `validateToken` on every page you define. This will
  ensure the user is not being malicious.
</Warning>

At this point the user is authenticated and we have their Whop User ID

## 3. Check if the user owns the product

We now want to check to make sure this user owns the correct product. To do this, we will use the **hasAccess** function from the SDK.

1. **Update the Whop SDK imports**

```js
import { validateToken, hasAccess } from "@whop-apps/sdk";
```

2. **Check if the user owns the product**

To check if the user should be able to access this page, we will use the `hasAccess` function. This function takes in an object with two properties:

- `to`: The resource the user is trying to access. In this case, it will be the product ID from the URL.
- `headers`: The headers of the request - this allows the SDK to get information about the user.

```javascript
const access = await hasAccess({ to: params.productId, headers });
```

3. **Handle the result**

If the user does not own the product, `access` will be `false`. If the user does own the product, `access` will be `true`.

Now, we are going to throw an error if the user is not allowed to view this page.

```javascript
if (!access) {
  return (
    <p>
      You do not have access to view this page as you do not own the correct
      product
    </p>
  );
}
```

Now we have confirmed the user has access to this product

## Next steps

- Launching in production
- Set up webhooks to get notified in real time
- Interact with the Whop API using your App's authentication
- Understanding constraints of the iFrame, like opening links
