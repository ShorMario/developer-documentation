The Whop Apps SDK is a collection of tools that allow you to interact with the Whop API, authenticate users, and interact with the browser.

## Installation

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @whop-apps/sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @whop-apps/sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @whop-apps/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

## Authentication

This aspect of the SDK allows you to authenticate the people trying to access your app, and make sure only people who have purchased are able to use it.

### validateToken

For this function, you need to get the user's token from the cookies, it is called `whop_user_token`. If you are using Next.js, you can use the `headers` object from `next/headers`

You should use this on every page that you want to be gated.

```typescript
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { validateToken } from "@whop-apps/sdk";

export default async function AdminPage() {
  await validateToken({ headers });
}
```

---

### getToken

This function will get the users Whop Token from the headers. You must pass the `headers` object.

```typescript
import { getToken } from "@whop-apps/sdk";
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export default async function Home() {
  const token = await getToken({ headers });
}
```

---

## API

The API SDK allows you to interact with the Whop API without having to manually write the requests. We handle the authorization, JSON responses, and errors.

### Usage

```typescript
import { whopJson } from "@whop-apps/sdk";
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export default async function Home() {
  // Using the users access token
  const productsObjcet = await whopJson("/products", { headers });

  // Using an API Key
  const productsObject = await whopJson("/products", {
    apiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY,
  });
}
```

In the example, we are using the `/products` endpoint. There are two ways to authenticate with the API, using the users access token, or using an API Key. Access token's are scoped to that specific user, but API keys are on the experience level, suitable for endpoints such as `/experiences`.

### Available routes

Here is a list of available routes, and their responses:

[THESE WILL LINK TO THEIR RESPECTIVE API PAGES]

- [/companies/\{id\}](/)
- [/companies/\{id\}/experiences]()
- [/uses/\{id\}](/)
- [/uses/\{id\}/experiences]()
- [/experiences](/)
- [/experiences/\{id\}](/)
- [/products](/)
- [/products/\{id\}](/)
- [/products/\{id\}/experiences](/)

## iFrame

The iFrame SDK allows you to interact with the browser and perform tasks such as opening a link in a new tab.

### Usage

```typescript
import { createAppIframeSDK } from '@whop-apps/sdk';
