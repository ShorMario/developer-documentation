## Whop Core SDK

<Note>
  View the NPM package [**here**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@whop-apps/core)
</Note>

This SDK will gather all the environment variables and validate them, making them accessible to the other SDKs.

### Required Variables

The following variables are required for the SDK to work properly, otherwise it will throw an error

- `WHOP_JWK_PK`: Public key used to verify JWTs. Encoded as a **JWK**. Exposed publicly on the [**Whop Dashboard**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer). TODO: actually expose this on the dashboard.
- `WHOP_API_KEY`: **API key** used to access the Whop API. Get this from the app developer page on the [**Whop Dashboard**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer).
- `WHOP_APP_ID`: **APP ID** of the current app. Get this from the app developer page on whop dashboard. Looks like: `app_XXXXXXXX`

## Whop Auth SDK

<Note>
  View the NPM package [**here**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@whop-apps/auth)
</Note>

This SDK will handle the authentication of the user. It uses the cookies stored in the request headers to ensure that only authenticated users can access the app.

### Usage

```typescript
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { validateToken } from "@whop-apps/auth";

export default async function AdminPage() {
  await validateToken({ headers });
}
```
