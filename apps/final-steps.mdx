This page will guide you through the final steps of creating and selling your App on Whop.

## Using our API

We have created an API that allows you to interact with the Whop platform. It allows you to fetch information about the user, company, products, experiences, and more! To get started, head to the [**API Reference**](/apps/api). Each endpoint also has an API Playground that allows you to test out the API and see what data is returned without having to write out the code.

## Hosting your app

Once your app is ready to be distributed to users, you will need to deploy it. We recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to host your app, but you can use any hosting provider you want.

Once you have your domain, you can insert it in the `Website URL` field on the [**App Settings**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer) page.

<Tip>
  There is no need to purchase a custom domain, the user will never get to see
  it.
