The most common apps TODO

Apps work by embedding an **iFrame** into Whop, giving a native feel to the experience. This means that you can use any web technology to build your app, such as React, Vue, Angular, etc. We also provide a [**TypeScript SDK**](/sdk) to make it easier to interact with the browser, API, and more!

## Why should I make an app

### Advantages for Companies

Developing your own apps allows your business to offer **hyper-niche** experiences catered to your unique needs. This approach not only enhances user experience (UX) but also sets you apart from your competition.

### Advantages for Developers

As you can monetize your apps, you can take a cut every time a company users your app. This is a great way to make a passive income, without needing to deal with the hassle of marketing and sales.
