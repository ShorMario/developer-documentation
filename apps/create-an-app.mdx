In this tutorial, you'll create an app that users can access in the Whop dashboard.

---

## What you'll learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to do the following tasks:

- Initialize a Next.js app with the Whop SDK
- Configure your app on the Whop dashboard
- Start your development server

---

## Requirements

- You've created a [Whop company](https://dash.whop.com/)
- You've installed [Node.js 16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or higher.
- You've installed a Node.js package manager: either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).
- You've installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- You're using the latest version of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
  > Note: Safari will not work with development mode. Please use Chrome

## Step 1: Create a new app

Follow the guide to create a Whop App using Next.js

<Note>
  If you are using our pre-built app template, you can skip this step and go
  directly to **Step 3**
</Note>

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your app. Your app will be created in a new subdirectory.
2. Run the following command to create a new Next.js application

<CodeGroup>

```bash yarn
yarn create next-app
```

```bash npm
npx create-next-app@latest
```

```bash pnpm
pnpx create next-app
```

</CodeGroup>

3. When prompted, enter a name for your app, then answer the remaining questions. We recommend using the default answers. You can [read more from Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app) if you have questions.

## Step 2: Install the Whop SDK

We have created a SDK to make it easier to build apps on Whop. It allows you to easily make requests to the Whop API, interact with the browser, open a local port for development, and more. Let's install it.

1. Navigate to your newly created app directory.

```bash
cd my-new-app
```

2. Install the Whop SDK

<CodeGroup>

```bash yarn
yarn add @whop-apps/sdk
```

```bash npm
npm install @whop-apps/sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @whop-apps/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

---

## Step 3: Setup your enviorment variables

Please add the following environment variables to your project. These are needed for the Whop SDK to function.

**Example ENV file**

```env
WHOP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
```

1. `WHOP_API_KEY`: The API key used to authenticate with the Whop API. Get this from the app's settings page on the [**Whop Dashboard**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer).

<Accordion title="How to get WHOP_API_KEY" >

Head to the [**Developer Settings Page**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer), and click on the applicable app you created. From here, you will see the `API Key` field. You need to click the `Copy` button to copy it to your clipboard.

</Accordion>

2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID`: The ID of your app. Get this from the app's settings page on Whop dashboard. Looks like: `app_XXXXXXXX`

<Accordion title="How to get NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID" >

Head to the [**Developer Settings Page**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer), and click on the applicable app you created. From here, you will see the `App ID`. You need to click the `Copy` button to copy it to your clipboard.

## Step 4: Installing Frosted UI (optional)

[**Frosted UI**](https://storybook.whop.com) is a UI library created by Whop, it contains all the components used to build [**Whop**](https://whop.com). Although it is not required, we recommend you use it to keep the same look and feel as the rest of the platform.

For information on how to install Frosted UI, click [**here**](https://github.com/whopio/frosted-ui)

<Tip>
  We recommend using Frosted as it will sync color preferences with the user's
  Whop preference.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Start a local development server

After your app is created and the SDK is installed, you can start your local development server.

Whop SDK will open up a secure port on your computer which will allow your development server to be shown in the iFrame.

1. Run the following command to start a local server for your app:

<Note>
  If you are using **NPM**, you need to add ```"whop-proxy": "whop-proxy"``` to
  the **scripts** section of your `package.json` file.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```bash yarn
yarn whop-proxy
```

```bash npm
npm run whop-proxy
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm whop-proxy
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Tip>
This will start a proxy server on port `3000`. If you would like to change the port, you can do so by running `yarn whop-proxy --proxyPort <port>`. Be sure to save your correct development url on the [app settings](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer/app_soLLJMDkBhQDtz).

</Tip>

2. Open your app in the Whop iFrame, and you will see the toggle in the bottom left of the page. This will only be available to members of your team, so customers will not see it.
