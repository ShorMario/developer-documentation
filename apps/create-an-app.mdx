These set of pages will guide you through the process of creating an app on Whop. It covers creating the app in the dashboard, setting up the app locally, and deploying the app to production.

There are four sections:

- [Getting Started](/apps/getting-started) - This section covers how to create your app in the Whop Dashboard, and attach it to a product.
- [Setting up your project](/apps/environment) - This section explains how to setup your project in Next.js, and installing the required dependencies, as well as getting the environment variables.
- [Setting up your routes](/apps/page-setup) - Here you will learn how to structure your project, and get information about the person accessing your app. It also covers how to authenticate the user to ensure only the right people are viewing it.
- [Final Steps](/apps/final-steps) - This section covers how to use our API, and deploy your app to production.

## Templates

To speed up the process of creating an app, we have created a **Next.js template** that you can use to get started. This will eliminate the need to setup your project from scratch, and you can get started with the fun stuff right away. You can find more information about it [**here**](/apps/next-template)
