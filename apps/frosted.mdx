## What is Frosted

Frosted is the design system used and and built by [**Whop**](https://whop.com).

### Why should I use Frosted

Using **Frosted** for your Whop Apps allows you to keep the same style as the rest of the Whop platform. It also syncs the color scheme as the rest of the site, so you don't have to worry about different display preferences.

## Components

There are over 30 components, you can find more information about them [**here**](https://storybook.whop.com).

### Layouts

Depending if you are using the App Directory or Pages, you will need to configure your project in different ways.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="layout.tsx (App Directory)" >

When using the App Directory in Next.js, you will need to configure your `layout.tsx`

```javascript
import { TooltipProvider, Toaster } from "@whop/frosted-ui";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import "@whop/frosted-ui/index.css";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <TooltipProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
      <Toaster />
    </TooltipProvider>
  );
}
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="_app.tsx (Pages)" >

When using `pages` in Next.js, you will need to configure your `_app.tsx`

## Example

### Installing a button

In this example, we are adding the Frosted [**Button**](https://storybook.whop.com/?path=/docs/forms-button--documentation) component to our page.

```javascript
import {Button} from '@whop/frosted-ui'

export default Home() {
  return (
    <Button>
      Click me
    </Button>
  )
}
```
