### Installing the Whop App SDK

<Tip>If you are using one of our templates, you can skip this step.</Tip>

We have created an SDK to make it easier to build apps for Whop. This SDK handles all the authentication, and API requests. To install it, run the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @whop-apps/sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @whop-apps/sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @whop-apps/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Note>
  For more information on what the Whop SDK can do, head to [**this
  page**](/apps/sdks).

### Installing Frosted UI

[**Frosted UI**](https://storybook.whop.com) is a UI library created by Whop, it contains all the components used to build [**Whop**](https://whop.com). Although it is not required, we recommend you use it to keep the same look and feel as the rest of the platform.

For information on how to install Frosted UI, click [**here**](https://github.com/whopio/frosted-ui)

<Tip>
  We recommend using Frosted as it will sync color preferences with the user's
  Whop preference.
</Tip>

### Environment Variables

For the Whop SDK to work, you will need to add the following environment variables to your project:

- `WHOP_API_KEY`: **API key** used to access the Whop API. Get this from the app's settings page on the [**Whop Dashboard**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID`: **APP ID** of the current app. Get this from the apps' settings page on whop dashboard. Looks like: `app_XXXXXXXX`
- `WHOP_WEBHOOK_KEY`: Key used to verify **webhook signatures**. Get this from the webhooks section on the [**developer dashboard**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer). You only need this if you are using our [**Webhook SDK**](/sdk/webhooks)

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Example ENV file" >

```env
WHOP_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID=
WHOP_WEBHOOK_KEY=
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to get WHOP_API_KEY" >

Head to the [**Developer Settings Page**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer), and click on the applicable app you created. From here, you will see the `API Key` field. You need to click the `Copy` button to copy it to your clipboard.

</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  When deploying your app, make sure these **are not hard-coded**. We recommend
  you use `.env.local` and to add it to your `.gitignore` file. This will
  prevent you from accidentally exposing your keys.
</Note>

### Developer Mode

As the app is ran in an iFrame and proxied through Whop, localhost development will not work. To get around this, we have created **developer mode**. This allows you to run your app locally, displaying real-time updates as you make changes.

To get started, run the following command:

<Note>
  If you are using **NPM**, you need to add ```"whop-proxy": "whop-proxy"``` to
  the **scripts** section of your `package.json` file.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm run whop-proxy
```

```bash yarn
yarn whop-proxy
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm whop-proxy
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Tip>
This will start a proxy server on port `3000`. If you would like to change the port, you can do so by running `npx whop-proxy --proxyPort <port>`
</Tip>

This will allow you to access your app on `http://localhost:3000`. Head to the [**App Settings**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer) and add that into the **Development URL** field.

You can now turn on developer mode on your app, and it will automatically update as you make changes. This toggle will only be shown to your team members, and will not be shown to your users.

  commands, head to the [**Whop Proxy Page**](/sdk/whop-proxy).
