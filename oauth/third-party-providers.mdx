## Setting up webhooks

Webhooks are sent when a user performs an action. In this example, we are going to look at when a user subscribes to your company and when they churn/leave your company. These are the `membership.went_valid` and `membership.went_invalid` events.

<Note>To learn how to setup webhooks, follow [this guide](/webhooks)</Note>

## Creating the user

Once you have setup webhooks, you can now listen to the `membership.went_valid` event. Once you receive it, you can create a user with your external provider, such as **Firebase** or **Supabase**.

## Removing the user

When a user leaves your company, you can listen to the `membership.went_invalid` event. Once you receive it, you can remove the user from your external provider.
